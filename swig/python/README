A simple client/server to test Speect voices.

The server listens on port 22222. This can be changed in server.py on line 60.
Voices can be loaded by the server in the "__main__" routine. See line 166 in server.py.
After setting the desired voice configuration files the server is simply started with "./server.py"
The server with print to stdout the voice file being loaded and when the voice is finished loading
the server will print the voice name to stdout.

The client sends synthesis requests to port 22222 at "localhost" by default. This can be changed
by editing client.py lines 60 and 61 or with command line options, -p or --port PORTNUMBER, and
-a or --address HOST. Usage of the client is 

./client.py [options] VOICENAME "text to be synthesized"

The VOICENAME is the name of the voice as reported by the server after loading the voice. If the -s or
--save WAVEFILE option is given then the returned wave is saved (riff format) to WAVEFILE

Send a SIGINT (CTRL-C) signal to the server to shut it down.
