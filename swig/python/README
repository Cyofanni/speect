A simple client/server to test Speect voices.


Operation:
----------
The server ("server.py") initializes Speect and loads voices specified
in a configuration file (an example can be found in this directory:
"server.conf.example"), serves requests and logs all activity to a log
file. The client ("client.py") can make synthesis requests or request
a list of loaded voices (names to be used when making synthesis
requests) from the server.


Running:
--------
Available options and usage information can be found by executing:

./server.py --help

or

./client.py --help

The VOICENAME is any of the names returned when requesting a voicelist from the server


Shutting down:
--------------
The server is shut down by sending a SIGINT (CTRL-C) signal to the process.
