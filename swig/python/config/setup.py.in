Speect is a multilingual TTS system. It offers a full text-to-speech system with
various API\'s, as well as an environment for research and development of TTS systems
and voices.

It is written in ANSI C and uses a plug-in mechanism for extensions. Speect also
includes an extensive set of Python bindings for quick implementation of new ideas,
these bindings are derived from SWIG (www.swig.org) interface files and can easily
be extended for other languages supported by SWIG.
