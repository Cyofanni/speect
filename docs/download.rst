The current version of Speect is 0.9.5 and is available for download 
on the `Speect Sourceforge project page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/speect>`_.

The latest development code can be cloned (read-only) with git
    :command:`git clone git://speect.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/speect/speect`


.. note::
   Speect has only been tested on **Linux**, but might work on *POSIX* compliant systems. 
   It will not compile on Windows machines. We hope to address this as soon as possible.
