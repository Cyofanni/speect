:mod:`speect.pyobject_ebml` -- Python Objects EBML Serialization Support
========================================================================

.. module:: speect.pyobject_ebml
   :synopsis: Support for Python objects EBML serialization 

This module does not add any classes or methods, but allows one to use
serialize Python objects in EBML format. Therefore a Speect object with
a predefined EBML serialization formatter, can have Python objects as
features, and still be able to read/write itself to an EBML format file.
