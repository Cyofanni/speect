Speect plug-ins are written in ANSI C/ISO C90 and should compile with any standards
compliant compiler, although we still need to do some extensive testing.

The bash script "clean_files" can be run to clean the build (delete the
cache and cmake makefiles) and to delete auto generated files and backup files.

First configure and build the Speect engine (see speect/engine/INSTALL).
Set the "SPEECT_PLUGINS" enviroment variable to the full path of your 
plug-in directory.

for example in bash do

export SPEECT_PLUGINS="/home/your_path/speect/plugins"

Now edit speect/plugins/cmake/options.cmake and set the SPEECT_DIR
path variable (line 37) to the full path of your Speect engine
directory (this is the root path to the Speect engine _source_
e.g. "speect/engine" where cmake configuration files from the engine
configuration can be found).

After Speect has been compiled you can just run "cmake ." in the 
speect/plugins directory to configure the plug-ins. There is no need 
to go through the configuration as with Speect as that configuration 
is imported by the plug-ins.

If no errors occurred one can build the plug-ins with the "make" command.


The speect/swig/python directory contains a Python client/server which
can be used with a voice. See the README in speect/swig/python
