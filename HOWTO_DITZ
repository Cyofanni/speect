Ditz HOWTO
==========


What?
=====

(from the ditz README) http://ditz.rubyforge.org

Ditz is a simple, light-weight distributed issue tracker designed to work with
distributed version control systems like git.

Ditz maintains an issue database directory on disk, with files written in a
line-based and human-editable format. This directory is kept under version
control, alongside project code.

Ditz provides a simple, console-based interface for creating and updating the
issue database files, and some basic static HTML generation capabilities for
producing world-readable status pages.


Why?
====

We have had a long standing need for documenting bugs, features etc. With Ditz
and git we can have a full track record of bug fixes, issue tracking and so on.
Ditz is very simple to use and has basic features, full blown issue trackers
take up a lot of time.


How?
====

We don't need much functionality, so here is a subset of what is required
on a daily basis:

   * ``ditz add`` Add an *issue*, *bug-fix* or *feature*.
   * ``ditz status`` Show assigned/unassigned issues, bugs, features.
   * ``ditz close`` Close a previously added issue.
   * ``ditz log`` Show full logs of all issues, bugs, features.

And that is basically it. There are more functions, use ``ditz help`` to
view them.

Ditz has a concept of releases, which are different versions of the system.
A ticket (bug-fix/feature/issue) is assigned to a release. We have just one
release that we are working on, Beryllium. 

Ditz creates and stores the ticket files in the .ditz directory. So, git has
to be updated after any changes have been done with Ditz.
