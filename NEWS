* December 2009
  Speect version 0.9.0 is a rewrite of version 0.1.0 with better error handling,
  logging and debugging. The build system has been redone to ease the bulding of 
  plug-ins. The plug-in system has changed completely with the Speect
  Engine having a minimal number of modules. All linguistic/acoustic objects and their
  implementation is now done through plug-ins.
