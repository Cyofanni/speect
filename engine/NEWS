Speect version 0.9.0 is a rewrite of version 0.1.0 with better error handling,
logging and debugging. The build system has been redone to ease the bulding of 
plug-ins. The plug-in system has changed completely with the Speect
Engine having a minimal number of modules. All linguistic/acoustic objects and their
implementation is now done through plug-ins.


The complete Python interface and voice building tools are not yet fully tested and
are not included in this release of Speect. These tools will be released in February 2010.
