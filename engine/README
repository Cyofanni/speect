version 0.9.5 RELEASE June 2010


Speect is a multilingual TTS system. It offers a full text-to-speech system with 
various API's, as well an environment for research and development of TTS systems
and voices. It is written in C with a Python interpreter for general customization
and quick implementation of new ideas, and uses a plug-in mechanism for extensions.


Speect is free and open source software. As a collection it is distributed under a 
MIT license, see LICENSE and COPYING for more details. See NEWS for more details of this
release.


To build Speect one needs cmake (http://www.cmake.org, minimum version 2.6) and
a ANSI C/ISO C90 compliant compiler. See INSTALL for more details. Python and SWIG
are required to use Speect as a TTS server.
