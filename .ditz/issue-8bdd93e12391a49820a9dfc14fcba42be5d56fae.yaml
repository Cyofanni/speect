    Handling the logging inside Speect gets too complicated, as we have
    to handle different processes from different users, and each of these
    might be multi-threaded. The easiest solution is to have each program
    supply a callback logging message handler, almost like GLib. Then it
    is up to the program to handle messages in anyway it likes, or
    even to disregard them.
