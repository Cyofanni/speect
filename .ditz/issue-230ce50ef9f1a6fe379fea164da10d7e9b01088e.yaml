title: Disabling error handling
desc: |-
  Disabling error handling is more involved that I have thought.
  I am also wondering if it is a good thing, as we are working with
  varied input from different sources. Currently all the error
  checking code grows the debug build of the engine from 587k to
  909k, which for now is not a problem, but for other platforms
  might be. We should leave this till later.
