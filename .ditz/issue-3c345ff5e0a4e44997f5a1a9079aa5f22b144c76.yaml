title: phrasify utt proc bug
desc: |-
  if a token with postpunc is normalised into multiple words, a phrase break is assigned after every word, instead of just the last one;
  proposed fix: around ln265 "if (is_present)": only proceed to add phrase break if the word is equal to the last daughter of its token parent;
