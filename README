Speect is a multilingual TTS system. It offers a full text-to-speech
system with various API's, as well as an environment for research and

extensions. Speect also includes an extensive set of Python bindings
for quick implementation of new ideas, these bindings are derived from
SWIG (www.swig.org) interface files and can easily be extended for
other languages supported by SWIG.
